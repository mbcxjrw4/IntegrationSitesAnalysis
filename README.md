# IntegrationSitesAnalysis
---
## 🔬 Overview
This pipeline analyses lentiviral vector (LV) integration sites from cell therapy drug products and post-infusion samples, focusing on genotoxicity risk assessment. It performs a comprehensive comparison with public datasets and evaluates safety based on:

- Insertion site sequence preference (sequence logo analysis)

- Gene-level integration patterns and insertion frequency

- Overlap with open chromatin regions

- Analysis of GC content at integration sites

- Clonality assessment of vector-containing T cells

- The output includes statistical summaries and a complete safety report for regulatory or scientific review.
